## What are Defense Actions?

**Defense Actions** are customized protection profiles for different endpoints on your site. Each Action is tailored to the specific risks and requirements of that endpoint type.

Think of Defense Actions as security policies - you might want different protection levels for a login page versus a contact form.

## Why use different Defense Actions?

Different endpoints have different risk profiles:

- **Login pages** need to detect credential stuffing and account takeover attempts
- **Registration forms** should check for fake emails and bulk account creation
- **Payment pages** require the highest security against fraud
- **Contact forms** need basic spam protection
- **API endpoints** may need different rate limiting and validation

## Common Defense Action Types

### Login Protection

- Detects credential stuffing attacks
- Identifies suspicious login patterns
- Protects against account takeover

### Registration Protection

- Validates email providers and domains
- Detects bulk account creation
- Checks for disposable email addresses
- Identifies automated signups

### Payment Protection

- Maximum security for financial transactions
- Advanced fraud detection
- Enhanced device fingerprinting
- Stricter IP reputation checks

### API Protection

- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Bot traffic identification
- Automated request detection

## Setting up a Defense Action

### 1. Create in Dashboard

1. Log into your Deflect dashboard
2. Navigate to "Defense Actions"
3. Click "Create New Action"
4. Select the appropriate type for your endpoint
5. Configure protection settings
6. Save and copy the Action ID

### 2. Use in your code

```js
// Configure the SDK with your Action ID
Deflect.configure({
  actionId: "YOUR_ACTION_ID", // The ID from your dashboard
});

// Get token when needed
const token = await Deflect.getToken();
```

### 3. Verify on backend

```js
// Send token to your backend for verification
const verification = await fetch("https://api.deflect.bot/verify", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    action_id: "YOUR_ACTION_ID", // Same Action ID
    token: token,
  }),
});
```

## Multiple Defense Actions

You can create multiple Defense Actions for different parts of your site:

```js
// Login page
Deflect.configure({ actionId: "login_action_id" });

// Registration page
Deflect.configure({ actionId: "register_action_id" });

// Payment page
Deflect.configure({ actionId: "payment_action_id" });
```

## Best Practices

- **Use specific Action types** - Don't use a generic action for specialized endpoints
- **Test before deploying** - Verify your Defense Action works in staging first
- **Monitor performance** - Check your dashboard for detection rates and false positives
- **Update configurations** - Adjust settings based on your traffic patterns
