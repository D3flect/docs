## What are Defense Actions?

**Defense Actions** are invisible bot protection mechanisms dynamically deployed on your endpoints â€” like `register`, `login`, `payment` and `more..`

Each Defense Action is designed to respond to the specific threat model of its associated endpoint and that means that we check specific things for each one.

For example, Defense Action of type `register` allows you to send us the email and password used and we can tell you where the email provider is legit / if the password is in a public credentials leak and much more.
