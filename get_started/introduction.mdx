## Welcome

Deflect is an advanced antibot engine that protects your site from bots on any scale. This guide will help you understand how to integrate and work with the Deflect SDKs & API.

## What can do you with Deflect?


- Block or challenge headless browsers and scrapers in real-time  
- Detect residential, proxy, VPN, or datacenter IPs  
- Protect signups, logins, and payments from bots 
- Score every session with a fingerprint trust score  
- Require proof-of-work or JavaScript challenge for suspicious users  
- Integrate bot protection with no visual CAPTCHA required  


## How does Deflect work?

Deflect uses multiple layers of passive and active detection:

- **integrity checks**   
- **IP reputation** (via Deflect Atlas)
- **Device fingerprinting**
- **Behavioral analysis**
- **Proof-of-Work enforcement**

## How to get started

1. **Install the SDK** (CDN or npm) → [JavaScript SDK →](/javascript-sdk)  
2. **Register a site and action** in your dashboard  
3. **Protect your frontend** using the SDK  
4. **Verify sessions** on your backend using the [Verify API →](/api-reference)
