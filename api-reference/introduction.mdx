## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.



## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an API key, that you can include in the payload

```json
"api_key": "DFL-4GI5-592JG9-4929J"
```
